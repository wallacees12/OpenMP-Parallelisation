Paralleisation should focus on the main computation loop where the forces between particles are computed.
- Heaviest computation => maximum speedup

Complications:

a - shared among all threads need to utilise pthread_mutext_lock


Inital issues, mutex lock and unlock causes huge slowdown, intead lets give each threead its own local acceleration
array size 2*N and updates this array locally no need to lock! Once threads are all finished main thread collects local
acceleration and sums to global and then frees per-thread arrs.
